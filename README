(for example poll() based) event loops.

elcc will run on linux and maybe other posix like OSes.

dependencies:
 * libedit [http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/]

licensing:
* elcc itself is released under a 2-clause BSD license. See LICENSE for details.
* libedit is using a 3 clause BSD license: http://www.netbsd.org/about/redistribution.html

An example integration with the libtscb reactor is provided, which requires

libedit.
